# Uity Samples

This repository was created to hold sample scripts generated while following along to tutorials and going through some online readings.

# Script Files:

## Player Script
This file shows the basic methods of gathering input from the user (via keyboard buttons in this case) and then generating some sort of in-game effect (e.g. jumping). Also explaored briefly is the use of Physics engine properties.

## DynamicEmissive Script
This script shows a sample method for activating and/or deactivating the emissive property of a game object during gameplay (e.g. when something is pressed or when a collider registers a trigger).

Stay awesome,
